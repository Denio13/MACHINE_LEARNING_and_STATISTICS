As of version 2.4, only  _TensorFlow_ is supported. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System) and its primary author and maintainer is [François Chollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet), a Google engineer.\n",

    "**Keras** allows users to productize deep models on smartphones (iOS and Android), on the web, or on the Java Virtual Machine.It also allows use of distributed training of deep-learning models on clusters of Graphics processing units (GPU) and tensor processing units (TPU)$^{[3]}$.\n",

A sequential model can be created by simply calling *Sequential()*\n",

Also, it allows multiple inputs, multiple outputs, branching, and layer sharing. It is a clean and easy-to-use method, and it still allows a good level of customization flexibility. The main idea is that a deep learning model is usually a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of layers. So, the functional API is a way to build layer graphs.\n",

Since Keras utilizes object-oriented programming, we can actually subclass the Model class and then insert our architecture definition.
