One of the presents was Ronald Fisher, and the story, along with a detailed description of how to conduct a simple experiment to test the claimed ability, and how to obtain an exact solution, was presented at length in the Chapter 2 of his book The Design of Experiments, a few lines of which are quoted below:</h5>"
